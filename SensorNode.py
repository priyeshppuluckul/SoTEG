# This package simulates the working of LoRaWAN Sensor Node transmitting 6 bytes at DR 5 data rate.
# Emprical values of energy consumption, lekage current are used. In addition, the operation of the
# Power Management Unit (PMU) is approximated using a model derived from the empirical measurements.
# Refer ./COPYING.txt for terms and conditions.
